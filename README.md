Overview

Welcome to my Chrome extension

Chrome extension for multi-apps, similar at the cellphone menu that can have many apps that help us in our routing. 
The first one was a TicTacToe game that a made in my first project at General Assembly Course. 
Next app was a search for recipes and the third app was a search for the weather. 

The big challenge was that when I deploy in chrome://extensions do not work, after a extensive research I learned that I could not use React Routes so I needed to change the apps, build outside of the Chrome Extension and link to a external link.

The objective of the project was to use all the technologies and knowledge that I have learned.

I wrote the project with **JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS** and have used external APIs to get all the data that I needed to build the Wheater and Recipes Apps.

After doing the basics I try to improve my code and make looks better, I focused on Bootstrap/CSS and try to make look pretty, but really need a lot to make look great!

I really wanted to make my project the most easy to read and understand.

Still need some good thinks like, ToDo app, Games, but everything could be better and better.

Do you want to see my project? I also deploy it at gh-pages [Chrome Extension](https://patricianunes.github.io/super-chrome-extension/)
